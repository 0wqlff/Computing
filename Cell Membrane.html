		<h2>Components of the Cell membrane.</h2>
		<p>Lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol): form a bilayer that acts as a barrier between the inside and outside of the cell.</p>
		<p>Proteins: perform various roles such as structural support, transport of substances, and communication between cells.</p>
		<p>Carbohydrates: attach to lipids or proteins and serve as recognition markers for other cells or molecules.</p>
		<h2>Why it is reffered to as the fluid Mosaic model.</h2>
		<p>The cell membrane is reffered to as fluid mosaic because it is made up of multiple types of molecules that float and move within the phospholipid bilayer.</p>
		<h2>Scientists involved.</h2>
		<p>In 1935 Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed the first model that tried to describe the position of proteins.</p>
		<p>A new model was proposed by Seymour Singer and Garth Nicolson in 1972.
		According to this model, proteins were embedded within the lipid bilayer rather than existing as separate layers.
		This model, known as the fluid-mosaic model, remains the model preferred by scientists today (with refinements).</p>
